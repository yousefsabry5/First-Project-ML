<h1># Housing Data Analysis Project</h1>

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about housing, including median income, number of households, proximity to the ocean, and other important characteristics.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Loaded the dataset and handled missing values and incorrect data.
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyzed the data using statistical descriptions and data visualization to understand the distribution of values and discover hidden patterns.
3. **Applying Analytical Models:** Used various techniques to analyze the data and predict future values based on the discovered patterns.
4. **Graphical Visualization:** Created graphs and visualizations that help in explaining the results and outputs in an easy-to-understand manner.

## Analysis Results

- Discovered strong relationships between median income and house values.
- The data showed a clear impact of ocean proximity on housing prices.
- Predictive models were used to estimate future values based on current data.

## What I Learned

This project helped me enhance my skills in data analysis and machine learning, and it showed me the importance of data in making evidence-based decisions.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my gratitude to the NTI institute and the Creativa initiative for providing me with the opportunity to learn and apply these skills through their scholarship program. Their support was instrumental in the completion of this project.
